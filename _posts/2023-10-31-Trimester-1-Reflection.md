# First Trimester Reflection:

## Week 0-3:
In the beginning weeks, I had some trouble getting tools like Github and VSCode ready, and figuring out how to make everything work took a lot of time. I made mistakes like misnaming files and had a hard time showing Python code on websites without using Javascript. But I was really happy to have a class that let me dive into computer science, which is what I love to do. I worked on simple things like making a to-do list app, and that helped me learn about how Javascript, web storage, and HTML work together.

## Week 4-7:
Once I got past the early challenges, I started to feel more sure of myself and began working on my own projects. I connected with Canvas LMS's system to show homework using Python and Flask, which improved my skills. For a test on basic web programming, I made changes to a website menu and built a skincare site, which helped me learn more about coding and web design.

## Week 7 marked the beginning of group teaching and our own special project.

## Week 8-12 (We're in Week 11 now):
During these weeks, I've been working on a project I really care about and teaching others. I've picked up a lot on how to work as a team, how to talk things through, and how to use APIs to make our projects better. I've really got to understand APIs and how they let the front and back parts of an app talk to each other, and I've gotten better at Python and Flask. We looked into things like putting apps on AWS, how web methods work, and using Postman for APIs. I wish I could have learned about managing databases with lots of data, but we haven't gotten to that yet. We also haven't learned about pulling out data and looking at it with Pandas. For teaching each other, we watched videos from the College Board and put together our own lessons.

Overall, this trimester has really made me more excited about coding and making my own projects. I've gone from not knowing where to begin with my ideas to someone who can't wait to work on personal projects, even when there isn't much time. I'm really looking forward to the Thanksgiving break to keep working on my projects.

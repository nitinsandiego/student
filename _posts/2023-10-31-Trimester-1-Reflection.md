# Trimester 1 Reflection:

## Week 0-3:
In the first few weeks of the trimester, setting up tools like Github, VSCode, and dependencies was challenging. I spent hours debugging simple errors, like incorrectly naming a Jupyter Notebook. I also struggled to display Python code on the frontend without using Javascript. However, I found it exciting to have a class dedicated to my passion for computer science, eliminating the uncertainty of where to start. I completed basic projects like a to-do list, which taught me Javascript interactions, local storage, and linking scripts to HTML pages.

## Week 4-7:
After the grace weeks, I gained confidence and began creating my projects. I used the Canvas LMS API to display homework assignments, improving my Python and Flask skills. During a Web Programming Basics Test, I customized a navigation bar and created a purposeful skincare website, learning about Jupyter notebook layout, Javascript functions, and loops.

## Week 7 marked the start of team teaching and our passion project.

## Week 8-12 (Current Week 11):
These weeks focused on our passion project and student teaching. I learned about teamwork, communication, and API usage to enhance projects. I discovered the true nature of APIs, their role in data communication between frontend and backend, and honed my skills in Python and Flask. Topics like AWS deployment, HTTP methods, and Postman API were also covered. While I hoped to learn about database management for handling large data, it remains unexplored. We didn't get to delve into data extraction and analysis using Pandas, and for student teaching, we watched College Board videos and created lessons.

Overall, this trimester has fueled my passion for coding and project creation. I've transformed from someone unsure of where to start with passionate ideas to someone eager to work on personal projects, despite time constraints. I'm looking forward to working on my projects during the upcoming Thanksgiving break.

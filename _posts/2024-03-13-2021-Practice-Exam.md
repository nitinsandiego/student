# My Score
- I scored **66/70** or **94.3%**

# Journey
- Increase from Trimester 2 score of **61/67** or **91.0%** and Trimester 1 of **56/67** or **83.6%**
- Reasons for improvement
    - More knowledge: All of the team teaches lots of content to give me an idea of the concepts the quiz tested me on
    - More practice: I did more practice problems and more practice tests, which helped me get a better idea of what the test would be like

## Question 27

Answer: **B** Testing the new algorithm on a random sample of users will help ensure that the data gathered are from a group that is representative of all users of the application. Gathering data and perspectives from a representative sample can help the developers avoid bias.

## Question 46

Answer: **D** Because the relative order of the rows is not changed when the filters are applied, the order in which the actions are performed does not matter. The filtering can occur either before or after the spreadsheet is sorted by rating.

## Question 55

Answer: **B** This code segment assigns the value of the last element of the list to the variable temp, then removes the last element of the list, then inserts temp as the first element of the list.

## Question 70
![alt text](</student/images/Screenshot 2024-03-13 at 8.21.39 PM.png>)
Answer: **A and C** A is correct because this code segment assigns the characters to the left of position n to the variable left and the characters to the right of position n to the variable right. It then concatenates left and right and assigns the result to newStr. For example, if oldStr is "best" and n is 3, the code segment assigns "be" to left, "t" to right, and "bet" to newStr. C is correct because this code segment assigns the characters to the left of position n to newStr. The code segment then concatenates newStr with the substring consisting of the characters to the right of position n. For example, if oldStr is "best" and n is 3, the code segment assigns "be" to newStr, then concatenates "be" and the substring "t" and assigns the result "bet" to newStr.

# Takeaways
### I learned that I struggled with these concepts during the quiz, so it’s important for me to spend extra time reviewing and studying them.
- Skill 3.B: Use abstraction to manage complexity in a program.
- Skill 2.B: Implement and apply an algorithm.
- Skill 5.E: Evaluate the use of computing based on legal and ethical factors.

# Some ways to Study AP CSP Exam
- Practice tests
- Practice problems
- Reviewing concepts
- Reviewing code
- Watching AP College Board videos
- Reviewing team teaches and going over main topics from the lessons

# Conclusion
I am pretty happy with my score of 66/70 as it reflects my improvement in my journey in AP CSP. From this quiz, I can tell I need to work on a few areas like using abstraction to manage complexity in a program, implementing and applying an algorithm, and evalutating the use of computing based on legal and ethical factors. At the same time, I can also reflect from this quiz that there are many areas that I am familiar with and feel comfortable with. To continue my practice for the AP CSP exam, I must review the lessons from the team teaches and the videos on AP Collegeboard. These will be really helpful in preparing for the exam and to get a 5 on the examn. Overall, this quiz was great pratice and helped me learn which skills I need to focus on and which I feel I am comfortable with.

Week 24<br>
Remember your end of Trimester final has been posted for a while.  I see this happening in two parts.<br>
Live Review 5 minutes with Review Ticket.  Team part where you show Theme, Features, Plans/Designs, and management of code completion with Pull Request/Issues.  Bonus credit will be for Deployment and being ready for Live review at the beginning of class.<br>
Review Ticket Only.   Individual part where my big focus is on mapping of your individual Features to CPT and 1-minute Video.  Extra credit will be for delivering this before Monday morning.<br>

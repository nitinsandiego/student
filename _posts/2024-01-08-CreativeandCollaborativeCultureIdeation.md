Something that I would code if I had absolute freedom in class would probably 

- A Formula 1 website that displays the latest news, standings, wins, and a system to buy tickets at the next race.
- An AI model that could predict prices of new sneaker drops and could help sneaker resellers make the best choice for buying and selling sneakers
- A Car website that would display the recent prices of cars, so buyers could make an informed decision about buying cars and make the best purchase for their money. 

I would motivate myself by the fact these tools would help other people and make lives more easier. I would be motivated to create these tools and dedicate time to making these tools as best as they can, so that is can be perfect for users to use in their daily lives. Overall, I'd keep myself pumped up by thinking about how the tools I'm making can help folks and make their lives easier. Knowing that my work can bring some extra ease and joy to people's daily routines would keep me excited. I want to create tools that are top-notch, so users can have a smooth experience. In a nutshell, I'm motivated to make a positive impact on people's lives through the things I create.

I'd track our success by creating a plan for our ideas and when we aim to finish them. Meeting the deadline would mean success, but if we miss it, we'll put in extra effort the following week to catch up.

 If I were coding something productive, I'd create a tool that gives real-time feedback on code quality, helping developers write cleaner and more efficient code. This way, they can be more productive and catch potential issues early on.

I really like your idea for a Premier League website that exhibits the top and latest news for tournaments and seasonal leagues. This is a very helpful and fund idea for the Premier League and football fans. I can see this idea will use many different programming concepts that are important in this technology-based society.

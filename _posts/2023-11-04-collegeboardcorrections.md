# College Board Test Corrections

## Question 41

I chose option C: I and III

The correct answer was D: II and III

III stated that the function would first sort, then keep palindromes, then shorten which was correct. However, option I said that it was going to do the shorten step before the keep palindromes step which is incorrect.

## Question 63

Line 4 should be removed because if the count is set to 0 inside the loop then the function will not give an accurate number of prime numbers in the list.

I chose line 7 which was incorrect.

Line 9 should also be removed because you should only increase the count of prime numbers in a list if the number is prime. If you increase it outside then it doesn't matter if the number is prime or not.

## Night at the Museum Reflection

Reflection on Real Estate Project Showcase Event

Our recent real estate project showcase event was a thrilling opportunity to unveil our cutting-edge technology, including an AI bot powered by OpenAI, comprehensive house listings, and integration with Google Maps API. The AI bot impressed attendees with its personalized recommendations, while the house listings feature and Google Maps integration offered seamless browsing and visualization.

Feedback highlighted the need to enhance our user interface for better user-friendliness. Despite positive reception, attendees noted areas for improvement, particularly in UI design. Moving forward, we're committed to refining our platform to ensure a seamless user experience that aligns with diverse user needs.

Overall, the event was a success, providing valuable insights for enhancing our platform's functionality and usability. With continued innovation and improvement, we're poised to revolutionize the real estate industry and deliver exceptional value to our users.

## Feedback I will add to my CPT Project

I will use the feedback from the showcase event to enhance my CPT project. The feedback will help me refine the user interface and ensure a seamless user experience. I will also leverage the insights to improve the platform's functionality and usability, aligning with diverse user needs. By incorporating these enhancements, I aim to deliver exceptional value to my users and revolutionize the real estate industry.

This feedback will be invaluable in guiding my project's development and ensuring that it meets the highest standards of quality and user satisfaction. I am excited to apply these insights and take my project to the next level, setting a new standard for real estate technology. With continued innovation and improvement, I am confident that my project will make a significant impact in the industry and provide unparalleled value to its users.

# Something I saw in Compsci that impressed me

I saw a stock market simulation in CSA that impressed me. It was fascinating to see how students could learn about the stock market and investment strategies through a hands-on, interactive simulation. The simulation allowed students to experience the dynamics of the stock market in a safe and controlled environment, providing valuable insights into investment principles and market behavior. I was impressed by the depth and complexity of the simulation, as well as its potential to cultivate financial literacy and critical thinking skills. It's a powerful example of how technology can be leveraged to enhance learning experiences and prepare students for real-world challenges.

# Something I saw outside of Compsci that impressed me
I saw someone from Video Design make a NBA edit that looked very clean and nicely edited. I like how I could see the student put a lot of work and dedication to make this very impressive video. I was impressed by the creativity and technical skill demonstrated in the edit, as well as the ability to capture the excitement and energy of the game. It's a great example of how visual media can be used to engage and inspire audiences, and I was inspired by the student's talent and passion for video design.

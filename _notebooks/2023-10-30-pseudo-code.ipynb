    "- Pseudo code is easy to read.\n",
    "- Arrows for variable assignment can be confusing.\n",
    "- I like the clear code separation with blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "- Use arrows to assign values to variables.\n",
    "- Loops use \"Repeat Until.\"\n",
    "- If and if-else statements are similar to Python.\n",
    "- MOD means finding the remainder when dividing two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 1\n",
    "- Programs A and B are almost the same.\n",
    "    - Program A shows \"i\" before printing.\n",
    "    - Program B shows \"i\" after printing."

    "# Problem 1\n",
    "## NumPy (Numerical Python) \n",
    "Purpose: NumPy is fundamental for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things a powerful N-dimensional array object and useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.\n",
    "    - `numpy.array()`: Creates an n-dimensional array. It is the foundation of NumPy, allowing for the performance of mathematical operations on arrays.\n",
    "    - `numpy.linspace()`: Returns evenly spaced numbers over a specified range, and it’s quite helpful in generating data points for plotting.\n",
    "## Pandas\n",
    "Purpose: Pandas offer data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series, which makes it suitable for data cleaning and analysis.\n",
    "    - `pandas.DataFrame()`: A two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).\n",
    "    - `pandas.read_csv()`: Reads a comma-separated values (csv) file into DataFrame, a common method for importing data from spreadsheets or databases.\n",
    "## Matplotlib\n",
    "Purpose: Matplotlib is a 2D plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.\n",
    "    - `matplotlib.pyplot.plot()`: Basic plotting function that allows for the creation of a variety of plots quickly.\n",
    "    - `matplotlib.pyplot.figure()`: Creates a new figure, which can be useful when generating multiple plots in the same script."

    "# Problem 2\n",
    "API: OpenWeatherMap API\n",
    "Type of API: RESTful API\n",
    "What it does: Provides weather data, which includes current weather, forecasts, nowcasts and historical weather data for any location in the world.\n",
    "Unique Feature: It has a One Call API endpoint that allows you to retrieve current, minutely, hourly, and daily weather forecasts using a single API call.\n",
    "Brainstorm Scenario: A potential application could be a personalized daily weather forecast notification system. Users receive notifications about the weather conditions of the day at their location, helping them plan their daily activities better."
